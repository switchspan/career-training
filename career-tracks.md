# Summary

This document outlines the job levels within IssueTrak for technical careers. The [software engineer I, II, III document][5amdoc] by [5AM][5am] is the primary inspiration for this document.

# Technical Career Tracks

IssueTrak has three (3) main technical career tracks: 

- Software Engineering (SWE)
- Engineering Productivity (EP)
- Program Management (PM)

## Software Engineering (SWE)

IssueTrak’s primary mission is to build software solutions for our clients. At IssueTrak, software engineers
build those software solutions. An IssueTrak Software Engineer must possess skills across various
software disciplines such as analysis and design, implementation, and test, as well as universal
disciplines such as communication and mentoring. The following represent the disciplines we
measure for our software engineers: 

- business modeling
- requirements
- analysis and design
- implementation
- test
- deployment
- configuration management and change control
- project management
- environment
- database
- user experience
- security
- communication
- mentoring 

Each software engineer at IssueTrak follows their own path of specialization, however all our software
engineers share a fundamental competence across each of the disciplines.
We don’t hire coders, though we do hire software engineers whose primary responsibility is to
implement solid code. We don’t hire requirements analysts, though we do hire software
engineers whose primary responsibility is to elicit requirements and communicate them to the rest
of the team. 

We do not rank our software engineers based on years of experience or degrees held. On the
contrary, we consider current results more than one’s past or pedigree. One moves along from a
Software Engineer I to a Software Engineer II by increasing their worth across any/all the growth
dimensions. Here are some examples of the distinctions of the entry criteria for each of the
levels:

### Software Engineer I
- Demonstrable competency in one or more software engineering disciplines
- Competent in both verbal and written communication
- A passion in and interest to absorb and employ new skills, especially in disciplines with non-existent or only nominal skill
- A willingness and eagerness to be mentored by more senior software engineers
- A desire to serve the mission of IssueTrak
 
### Software Engineer II
- Demonstrable competency in three or more software engineering disciplines
- Successful experience as a team member on one or more complete software project major or minor releases
- Good working knowledge of all the software engineering disciplines and the processes and technologies that support them
- A willingness and eagerness to mentor peers and more junior software engineers

### Software Engineer III
- Demonstrable competency in four or more software engineering disciplines
- Successful experience on three or more complete software project major or minor releases
- Successful experience on one or more complete software project major or minor releases while on a IssueTrak team
- Successful experience mentoring peers and more junior software engineers
- Demonstrable proficiency in at least one of the software engineering disciplines 

### Senior Software Engineer
- Demonstrable competency in five or more software engineering disciplines
- Successful experience on four or more complete software project major or minor releases
- Successful experience on two or more complete software project major or minor releases while on a IssueTrak team
- Successful experience mentoring peers and more junior software engineers
- Demonstrable proficiency in at least two of the software engineering disciplines 

### Principal Software Engineer

TBD - Growth title

## Engineering Productivity (EP)

The engineering productivity track includes QA (Test Engineers) as well as SETs. 

### Software Engineer in Test (SET)

SETs are a sub-track of Software Engineering with the same levels thru Principal Software Engineer in Test (PSET). SETs test well beyond what can be done by unit testing (integration, performance, scale, reliability, etc.), and write programs, tools, and automated tests to aid in the effort. For this track, follow the above disciplines for software engineering, but place more emphasis on test and environment disciplines.

### Test Engineering (TE)

An IssueTrak Test Engineer must possess skills across various software disciplines related to test, as well as universal disciplines such as communication and mentoring.

The following represent the software engineering disciplines related to test:
- requirements
- risk analysis
- test
- configuration management and change control
- environment
- database
- user experience
- security
- communication
- mentoring 

### Test Engineer I
- Demonstrable competency in one or more software engineering disciplines related to test
- Competency in both verbal and written communication
- A passion in and interest to absorb and employ new skills, especially in disciplines with non-existent or only nominal skill
- A willingness and eagerness to be mentored by more senior Test Engineers
- A desire to serve the mission of IssueTrak

### Test Engineer II
- Demonstrable competency in three or more software engineering disciplines related to test
- Successful experience as a team member on one or more complete software project major or minor releases
- Good working knowledge of all the software engineering disciplines and the processes and technologies that support them
- Successful experience mentoring peers and more junior Test Engineers

### Test Engineering Manager
- Demonstrable competency in four or more software engineering disciplines related to test
- Successful experience on three or more complete software project major or minor releases
- Successful experience on one or more complete software project major or minor releases while on a IssueTrak team
- Successful experience mentoring peers and more junior Test Engineers
- Demonstrable proficiency in at least one of the test related software engineering disciplines related to test

## Program Management (PM)

Program Management is "process of managing multiple ongoing inter-dependent projects."
This is a growth career track for management in development which is not currently being used - but planned for future expansion.
The following represent the disciplines we measure for a program manager:

- project integration management
- project scope management
- project time management
- project cost management
- project quality management
- project human resource management
- project communications management
- project risk management
- project procurement management
- project stakeholder management

The 10 disciplines correspond directly to the [PMBOK][pmbok] 9 knowledge areas.

## Technical Growth Path

There are three dimensions within the technical growth path at IssueTrak.

### First Dimension -- Keeping Afloat

It is a fact of life that software engineering requires a steady dose of education simply to remain
vital and effective. Without deliberate and concentrated effort to keep up with our industry,
software engineers can lose their usefulness. Consider these simple examples. An engineer
considered to be expert in C++ or PERL implementation might still have absolutely zero talent in
Ruby, Java, or AJAX development. While one can benefit from their experience, individual
technologies do get obsolesced and/or replaced over time and it is imperative that our software
engineers remain current just to keep afloat. 

### Second Dimension -- Increasing Depth of Expertise in Specific Disciplines

While we need our software engineers to have a broad appreciation and ability in our field, we still
anticipate that people will develop expertise in specific disciplines. Developing expertise in a
specific discipline is dependent on several factors, including exposure, aptitude, interest, and
experience. 

### Third Dimension -- Increasing Overall Breadth of Expertise Across Disciplines

Having an understanding and appreciation for each of the disciplines is one thing, but actually
having a degree of proficiency in many or all of them is even more valuable. The role of software
architect, for example, requires a breadth of ability so that the architect can make valuable and
considerate decisions.
