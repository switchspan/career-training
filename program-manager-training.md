Program Manager Training
========================

The following document outlines the current list of [Pluralsight][pluralsight] training used by IssueTrak for Program Manager. The **(B)** flag denotes the basic (or first) training video that should be taken in each of the disciplines.

In order to be counted toward career development skills, the assessments must be completed successfully and submitted to your manager (_Managers: the completed assessments and peer reviews must be added to the personnel file_).

The courses below may change as we refine this, so please ensure you note the _Last Modified_ date when documenting your plan for coaching sessions.

### Skill Acquisition

The skill acquisition levels roughly follow the [Dreyfus Model][dreyfus]. They are not perfect -- measuring skills can be challenging at best.

Level | Name | Requirement
------|------|-------------
1 | Novice | None. This is where we all start.
2 | Advanced Beginner | Successfully complete the assessment for a course marked with a **(B)** in the selected discipline
3 | Competent | Complete the _Advanced Beginner_ requirements and then complete half of the assessments listed for a given discipline
4 | Proficient | Complete the all of the assessments listed for a given discipline and be given a written recommendation for that discipline from either a peer or supervisor.
5 | Expert | Complete all of the previous levels, become the primary source of knowledge and information in the discipline (i.e. write a book, do a lecture circuit, obtain a PHD). Yes - this is hard.
